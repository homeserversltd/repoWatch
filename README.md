## The Problem

It's 2 AM. You have **7 projects open**. You've spun up **3 agents** — one is refactoring your auth system, another is building a new feature, and the third one... wait, what was the third one doing? Something about tests? Or was that yesterday?

You're a **vibe coder**. You don't do linear. You do *parallel*. You context-switch like a caffeinated hummingbird. One moment you're deep in your iOS app, the next you're fixing a bug in your web dashboard, and somehow you ended up redesigning your database schema in a completely different project.

This is the way. This is the *vibe*.

But then comes **The Question™**: *"What have you actually accomplished this week?"*

You freeze. You have mass-produced more code than an LLM factory. But you couldn't tell anyone what. It's all a beautiful blur of:

- *"Let's spin up two agents for this"*
- *"Actually, let's also tackle that other thing"*
- *"Oh wait, I should check on that project from Tuesday"*
- *"New idea! Let me just quickly..."*

**Your brain is a chaos engine. This tool is your flight recorder.**

## The Solution

This tool digs through your Claude Code history across **ALL your projects** and reconstructs what you actually did. It's like having a second brain that actually remembers things — organized by project, by day, by session.

Finally, you can answer: *"What was I working on in that recipe app last Thursday?"* without scrolling through 47 conversation threads.

### Features

- **Multi-Project Dashboard** — See all your projects in one place, sorted by activity
- **Session Timeline** — Every coding session, every project, every day
- **AI-Powered Summaries** — Claude Opus 4.5 turns your chaotic sessions into coherent bullet points
- **Expandable Messages** — Click to see exactly what you asked (and what rabbit holes you went down)
- **GitHub Commit Links** — Connect your sessions to actual commits (proof you shipped something!)
- **Tag Support** — Links to releases when available, because you're professional like that
- **[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) Integration** — See all your agent issues in one place, filterable by status and type
- **Search Everything** — Find that one session where you "fixed the auth thing" across all projects
- **Date Filtering** — What did I do last week? Last month? Before my mass-deletion spree?
- **Cron-Ready** — Runs daily in the background. Set it and forget it. (You will forget it. That's the point.)

## Perfect For

- 🧠 **ADHD Coders** — External memory for when your internal memory said "nah"
- 🐙 **Multi-Project Jugglers** — Track progress across your entire portfolio of half-finished side projects
- 🤖 **Agent Wranglers** — Remember what you told your agents to do (and whether they did it)
- 🌀 **Context Switchers** — Pick up exactly where you left off, even if "where you left off" was 5 projects ago
- 📝 **Accountability Seekers** — Prove to yourself (and others) that you're actually productive

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Claude Code (with some history to analyze)
- An Anthropic API key (optional, for enhanced summaries)
- Multiple projects in various states of completion (mandatory for true vibe coders)

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/eranshir/claudeHistory.git
cd claudeHistory

# Install dependencies
pip install anthropic

# Set up your API key (optional but recommended)
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Run the analyzer
python3 claude_history_analyzer.py

# View your history
python3 -m http.server 8080
open http://localhost:8080
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

```bash
# Full analysis with AI summaries
python3 claude_history_analyzer.py

# Quick analysis without API calls (uses built-in summaries)
python3 claude_history_analyzer.py --no-api

# Force refresh everything (when you need a fresh start)
python3 claude_history_analyzer.py --force-refresh

# Custom output location
python3 claude_history_analyzer.py --output ~/my-history.json
```

### Daily Auto-Updates (Set It and Forget It)

Because you *will* forget to run this manually:

```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs daily at 9 PM)
0 21 * * * /path/to/claudeHistory/run_analyzer.sh
```

Now your history updates itself while you're busy starting another project.

## How It Works

```
~/.claude/
├── history.jsonl          ← Your prompts across ALL projects
└── projects/
    ├── project-a/
    │   └── session-123.jsonl   ← Full conversation history
    ├── project-b/
    │   └── session-456.jsonl
    └── ...
```

The analyzer:
1. **Scans** your entire Claude Code history
2. **Groups** by project and date
3. **Extracts** summaries (Claude already summarizes your sessions!)
4. **Enhances** with AI-generated daily overviews
5. **Links** git commits within session timeframes
6. **Discovers** [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) issues in your projects
7. **Renders** everything in a searchable web UI

## Configuration

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--output`, `-o` | Where to save the JSON (default: `history_data.json`) |
| `--force-refresh`, `-f` | Regenerate everything from scratch |
| `--no-api` | Skip AI summaries (faster, free, slightly less pretty) |

## Privacy

- **100% Local** — Your history stays on your machine
- **API calls only to Anthropic** — And only for generating summaries
- **Secrets are gitignored** — `.env` and `history_data.json` never leave your machine
- **No telemetry** — We respect the chaos. We don't track it.

## FAQ

**Q: I have like 20 projects. Will this slow down?**
A: The analyzer is incremental — it only processes new sessions. First run might take a minute, subsequent runs are fast.

**Q: Some summaries look weird?**
A: Sessions without built-in Claude summaries get a fallback. Use the API key for better results.

**Q: Can I see what my agents did?**
A: Yes! Agent sessions are captured just like regular sessions. You'll finally know if that background refactor actually finished.

**Q: What's the Beads integration?**
A: If you use [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (the AI-friendly issue tracker), this tool automatically discovers and displays all your Beads issues per project. Filter by open/closed, bug/feature/task, and see close reasons for resolved issues. Perfect for tracking what your agents have been working on.

**Q: I accidentally mass-deleted my ~/.claude folder. Can this help?**
A: No. This tool reads history, it doesn't create it. I'm sorry for your loss. 🕯️

**Q: Is this official Anthropic software?**
A: Nope! Just a tool built by a fellow vibe coder who kept losing track of their 15 concurrent projects.
